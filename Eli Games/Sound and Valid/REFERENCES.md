## 1. The Formula

### Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory: Bending Natural Frequency

The app computes the fundamental bending frequency of a rectangular bar using:

```
f = (βL)² × h / (4π√3 × L²) × √(E / ρ)
```

This is derived from the general Euler-Bernoulli beam equation:

```
f_n = (β_n L)² / (2πL²) × √(EI / ρA)
```

by substituting the second moment of area `I = bh³/12` and cross-sectional area `A = bh` for a rectangular cross-section, which simplifies `√(EI/ρA)` to `h/(2√3) × √(E/ρ)`.

## 3. Frequency Cross-References

### Tuning Fork: Strongest Validation

Our app computes a steel cantilever prong (L = 84 mm, h = 3.8 mm, steel) at **444.0 Hz**.

- A standard A4 tuning fork produces **440 Hz**, within **0.9%** of our result
- Real tuning fork prong dimensions are approximately 80 mm long, 4-4.5 mm cross-section
- **COMSOL Blog, Tuning Fork Simulation**: https://www.comsol.com/blogs/finding-answers-to-the-tuning-fork-mystery-with-simulation/
  - COMSOL computed 435 Hz for an 80 mm prong using the cantilever formula, noting it provides "a good approximation"
  - Our slightly longer prong (84mm vs 80mm) and slightly thinner cross-section (3.8mm vs ~4mm) account for the difference
- **Engineers Edge, Tuning Fork Calculator**: https://www.engineersedge.com/calculators/tuning_fork__16141.htm
  - Provides an online calculator using the same cantilever beam formula we use

### Steel Ruler Cantilever: Classroom Demo

Our app: 8 cm ruler, 1 mm thick, clamped → **128.8 Hz**

- This is a reasonable buzzing pitch for a short clamped ruler
- A 15 cm ruler at 1 mm thick computes to ~37 Hz (the low "twang" heard in classroom demos)
- **Syracuse University, Vibrations Lab**: https://ecs.syr.edu/faculty/glauser/mae315/vibesLab/goodVibesExpvIII.html

  - Uses meter sticks as cantilevers; confirms the inverse-square relationship between length and frequency

### Marimba / Xylophone Bars: With Important Caveat

- **Percussion Clinic Adelaide, Marimba Bar Dimensions**: https://www.percussionclinic.com/art_marimbuild24.htm
  - Jim McCarthy recommends a middle C bar at "about 36 cm long by 5.5 cm wide by 2 cm thick"
  - Our formula computes 670 Hz for those dimensions, which is much higher than 262 Hz (middle C)
  - McCarthy explains this is intentional: the bar must be **arched on the underside** to lower the pitch
  - The arch thins the center of the bar, reducing the effective thickness and lowering the frequency
  - **Our formula correctly computes the frequency for a uniform-thickness bar**, which is exactly what our app models
- **Real xylophone data** from https://www.mmdigest.com/Tech/breen_xylo.html:
  - A440 bar: 8.25 inches (20.96 cm) long, 1.5 in wide, 0.75 in thick (with arched thinning to 0.375 in)
  - The arching roughly halves the effective thickness, which is why the formula with full thickness overestimates
- **AIP, "Xylophone Bars: Frequency and Length"**: https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/pte/article/54/6/325/277943/Xylophone-bars-Frequency-and-length
