/**
 * Object catalog: 18 objects spanning all material categories.
 *
 * Each object has a specific material, geometry, and boundary condition.
 * Dimensions are chosen so that fundamental frequencies land mostly
 * in the range 80–1000 Hz (achievable by humming, singing, or whistling).
 *
 * Difficulty ratings:
 *   1 = easy (200–500 Hz range, comfortable singing range)
 *   2 = medium (100–200 Hz or 500–800 Hz)
 *   3 = hard (below 100 Hz or above 800 Hz)
