# StructureStrike

**Build structures. Survive the forces.**

A browser-based structural engineering game for STEM students. Place nodes, connect them with beams, columns, trusses, and cables, then run a physics simulation to see if your design survives escalating real-world force events.

---

## Concept

Each level presents a scenario (warehouse collapse, coastal tower, seismic frame, harbor flood, bunker impact) with a fixed budget. You design a structure on a blueprint canvas, then watch it get rendered into a 2D world scene and subjected to physics-based loading. The simulation uses a real Finite Element Method solver — the same mathematical framework used by professional structural engineering software.

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Select Level** — choose from 5 unlockable scenarios on the home screen
2. **Build Phase** — tap empty grid to place nodes; tap two nodes to open the element picker and connect them; manage your budget
3. **Simulate** — the blueprint fades into a world scene; FEM runs; forces are applied; watch for progressive collapse
4. **Results** — pass: earn up to 3 stars and unlock the next level; fail: debrief modal explains what broke and why

## Levels

| # | Scenario | Threat | Challenge |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Mountain Warehouse | Dead load (gravity) | Span a roof across two pinned supports |
| 2 | Coastal Tower | Wind (120 km/h) | Build a slender tower that resists lateral pressure |
| 3 | Urban Building | Seismic (0.4g) | Design a two-story frame for horizontal inertial loads |
| 4 | Harbor Dock | Flood (4 m head) | Resist hydrostatic pressure across submerged nodes |
| 5 | Blast Bunker | Ballistic (2500 kN) | Protect a floor node from a point impact load |

## Physics Engine

No external physics library. All simulation runs client-side using a custom **Direct Stiffness Method (DSM)** Finite Element solver:

- **2D Euler-Bernoulli beam-column elements** — 3 DOF per node (u, v, θ)
- **Cables** — truss-like (I ≈ 0) with tension-only iteration; slack cables are removed and the system is re-solved
- **Gaussian elimination** with partial pivoting; singular matrices → mechanism detection
- **Progressive collapse** — failed elements are removed iteratively; simulation continues until stable or total collapse
- **Units** — SI throughout (N, m, Pa); 1 grid cell = 5 metres

## Civil Engineering Equations

The following fundamental equations are explicitly implemented in the simulation:

### Implemented

| Equation | Formula | Where Used |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Hooke's Law** | σ = Eε | Axial stress in all elements (`elements.js`) |
| **Bending Stress** | σ = Mc/I | Extreme fibre stress in beams and columns (`elements.js`) |
| **Moment of Inertia** | I = ∫y²dA | Section property for each element type (`constants.js`) |
| **Shear and Bending Moment** | V = dM/dx | Internal force extraction from local stiffness (`elements.js`) |
| **Bernoulli Wind Pressure** | p = ½ρv²Cd | Tributary area wind load on exposed nodes (`loads.js`) |
| **Hydrostatic Pressure** | p = ρgh | Flood load on nodes below flood elevation (`loads.js`) |
| **Seismic Equivalent Static Force** | F = mSa·sin(2πft) | Time-varying inertial load on level masses (`loads.js`) |
| **Euler Column Buckling** | Pcr = π²EI/L² | Compression check on columns and trusses (K=1, pin-ended, `elements.js`) |

### Not Applicable to This Game

| Equation | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Darcy-Weisbach / Manning's / Continuity | Hydraulic pipe flow — no pipe networks in scope |
| Terzaghi Bearing Capacity | Soil mechanics — foundations are idealized as pin/roller/fixed supports |
| Mohr's Circle | 2D stress state visualization tool — not needed in 1D beam FEM |

## Structural Patterns

The game detects 13 named structural patterns as you build and fires educational notifications:

- **Common** — Triangle, Portal Frame, Cantilever, Simply Supported Beam
- **Uncommon** — Pratt Truss, Warren Truss, X-Brace, King Post, Arch
- **Rare** — Cable-Stayed, Diagrid, Vierendeel Frame
- **Legendary** — Tensegrity, Suspended Cable Net
